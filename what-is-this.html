title:  "What is this?"
---

<p>Hi there. I'm <a href="http://steveklabnik.com">Steve</a>. <code>/me waves</code>. Metaphysics.io is,
in short, a project of mine to consider the possibilities of an intersection
between philosophy and technology.</p>
<p>It's important to understand what exactly I mean by 'philosophy' here, though.
I am deeply inspired by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Is-Philosophy-Gilles-Deleuze/dp/0231079893">"What is
philosophy?"</a>
by Gilles Deleuze and FÃ©lix Guattari. In the book, they posit definitions for
three disciplines: art, science, and philosophy. Many a blog post has been
written about programming, and its relationship to art and science. "Is
programming art?" "Is programming science?" In the past, I have been deeply
interested in these questions. But this is a place for the third, slightly
modified: "What does a philosophy of technology look like?"</p>
<p>Note that I say "a philosophy," not "the philosophy." This is very deliberate.
You see, D&amp;G have a definition of philosophy that is radically different than
many others. To them, and to me, "philosophy is the discipline that involves
creating concepts." And concepts are not measured by their 'truth value,'
whatever that means, but by how much they can get you to think. By the
additional perspective they offer. By how many times you go "Oh, <em>that</em> is
interesting..." and reconsider something you thought you previously knew.</p>
<p>While "the creation of concepts" makes for a good slogan, <em>how</em> does one create
a concept? Concepts are created through two other things: a <strong>plane</strong>, and a
<strong>conceptual persona</strong>.</p>
<p>The 'plane of immanence' is the whole second chapter of the book, and there's
an evocative image early on in the chapter: "The plane is like a desert that
concepts populate without dividing up. The only regions of the plane are
concepts themselves, but the plane is all that holds them together. The plane
has no other regions than the tribes populating and moving around on it. It is
the plane that secures conceptual linkages with ever increasing connections,
and it is concepts that secure the populating of the plane on an always renewed
and variable curve." There is a lot to say about the plane, and how it is
immanent, not transcendent, but I personally like to visualize it as a
mathematical plane, rather than a desert: it's a surface, that extends
infinitely, in all directions. This plane is one of Deleuze's primary
metaphysical concepts, but for our purposes, just think of it as this infinite
surface.</p>
<p>Next, the conceptual persona. There are two quotes that I think are relevant to
give you an idea of what personae are. The first: "Conceptual personae
constitute points of view according to which planes of immanence are
distinguished from one another or brought together, but they also constitute
the conditions under which each plane finds itself filled with concepts of the
same group." A persona is what creates concepts and places them onto the plane.
On this plane, concepts are grouped together, and it's the persona who does
this grouping. I visualize this as a filter: if the plane is infinite, and
there are concepts placed all over it, the persona filters out the concepts
that it has created. This is another way of phrasing the "point of view" which
"distinguishes" "concepts of the same group."</p>
<p>The second quote is "The conceptual persona is not the philosopher's
representative but, rather, the reverse: the philosopher is only the envelope
of his principal conceptual persona." We often think about a persona as a role
played by a person, as though the person is 'real' and the persona is 'fake.' A
persona is something external that you temporarily inhabit. As D&amp;G say, this is
actually the reverse: a philosopher is inhabited <em>by</em> a persona. And sometimes
more.</p>
<p>Finally, the concept itself. A concept is more than just a simple 'idea.' A
concept is put in relation to a specific problem, and in relation with other
concepts. This relations are due to their proximity to each other on the plane.
I want to say that they form a mesh, but that's a little too coherent. D&amp;G
describe this influence not as a correspondence, but as a vibration. Two
different vibrations can resonate with one another. If these vibrations are
sound, they can sound harmonic, or sound discordant. Two concepts aren't so
much linked in a mesh but are producing vibrations, some of which harmonize,
and some of which do not. If you described two concepts as being linked
together, it's a binary relation: they're either linked or they're not. But two
vibrations can harmonize in different ways. Take a wonderful harmonic chord,
and add an additional member, and you may get a new chord, or you may get
dissonance. Furthermore, your ear may prefer different chords and harmonies
than mine.</p>
<p>Anyway, when creating a new concept, a persona may survey the plane, and see
other persona's concepts. Their new concept may just end up resonating with
another persona's existing one. Or, the existing concept may be <em>almost</em> what
they want, and so they'll copy it, tweak things, and make it their own. It's
often useful to see the world from another persona's point of view. It can be
the spark that inspires you to forge something that's entirely different.</p>
<p>So, in a longer sense, <code>metaphysics.io</code> is my little plane, on which my persona
will be placing some concepts. Some will be fully formed, and others will be
more tentative. It's my hope that they may give you some interesting
perspectives, show you some new harmonies, and cause you to create your own
concepts.</p>
